You can preview the website here: [SnapMart Inc.](https://snapmart-blond.vercel.app/)

## Running a this app locally

To run a Next.js app, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official website.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Once you have Node.js installed, navigate to the directory where your Next.js app is located in your terminal or command prompt. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in your package.json file.

### Step 2: Run the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and your app will be available at <http://localhost:3000>. The development server supports hot reloading, which means that any changes you make to your code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

### Step 3: Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy your app to production, you'll need to build it first. You can build your app by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready version of your app in the /.next directory.

### Step 4: Start the Production Server

After building your app, you can start the production server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the production server and your app will be available at <http://localhost:3000>. Note that you should only run the production server in a production environment, and not in a development environment.
